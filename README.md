Land Registry Smart Contract: 
Overview:
This project implements a basic Land Registry smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the registration of land parcels, transfer of land ownership, and retrieval of land details.  This provides a transparent and immutable record of land ownership.
Features:
 * Land Registration:  Registers new land parcels with a unique ID, location, area, and initial owner.
 * Ownership Transfer:  Facilitates the transfer of land ownership from the current owner to a new owner.
 * Land Information Retrieval:  Allows querying land details by ID.
 * Event Emission: Emits events for land registration and ownership transfer, enabling off-chain tracking.
Usage:
This contract can be used to build a decentralized land registry system.  Users can register their land, transfer ownership securely, and verify land information.  Potential applications include property management, real estate transactions, and land record keeping.
Tech Stack:
 * Solidity:  The smart contract is written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
 * Ethereum Blockchain: The contract is deployed and runs on the Ethereum blockchain.
 * Development Environment (Optional):  Tools like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle can be used for development, testing, and deployment.
Installation (using Remix as an example):
 * Open remix.ethereum.org in your browser.
 * Create a new file (e.g., LandRegistry.sol).
 * Paste the Solidity code into the file.
Steps to Run the Project (using Remix):
 * Compile: In the Solidity Compiler tab, select the appropriate compiler version and compile the contract.
 * Deploy: In the Deploy & Transactions tab:
   * Choose an environment (JavaScript VM for testing, or Injected Provider for connecting to a real Ethereum network via MetaMask or similar).
   * Select the LandRegistry contract.
   * Click "Deploy".
 * Interact: After deployment, the contract functions will be available.  Enter the required parameters for each function (e.g., registerLand, transferOwnership, getLand) and click the function button to execute them.  Note that transactions on a real network will require gas (ETH).
 * View Events: Events emitted by the contract can be viewed in the Remix console, providing a history of actions.
